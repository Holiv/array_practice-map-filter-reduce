# Array - Coding Challenge [map, filter and reduce]

### Coding Challenge to practice Array methods (2)

[Read the code here](./array_coding-challenge.js)

### *The challange*

Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

**Create a function 'calcAverageHumanAge', which accepts an arrays of dog's ages ('ages'), and does the following things in order:**

1. *Calculate the dog age in human years using the following formula: if the dog is <= 2 years old, humanAge = 2 * dogAge. If the dog is > 2 years old, humanAge = 16 + dogAge * 4.*
2. *Exclude all dogs that are less than 18 human years old (which is the same as keeping dogs that are at least 18 years old)*
3. *Calculate the average human age of all adult dogs*
4. *Run the function for both test datasets*


TEST DATA 1: [5, 2, 4, 1, 15, 8, 3]

TEST DATA 2: [16, 6, 10, 5, 6, 1, 4]
